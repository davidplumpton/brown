Brown: Browsing Nirvana

A plugin for Google Chrome that finds the next page you want to see using a single hotkey.

Rather rough around the edges at this stage, but it does exactly what I want. Configure URLs
along with a desired browsing frequency which are stored using Local Storage, e.g.

30h = 30 hours
1d  = 1 days
3w  = 3 weeks

Then press Ctrl-Shift-Y (or Cmd-Shift-Y on a Mac) to have Brown open the next site to visit
it in a new tab (you need to open one page first after installing Brown to register the hotkey).

Exporting config is just copy/paste of the config JSON data. To import press the Import Config
button and paste the JSON text into the field and press Save Config.

The URLs can be seen in the popup window and selected ahead of time, which also causes the
URL's next visit time to be rescheduled.
